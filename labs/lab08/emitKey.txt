1. Weâ€™ve seen that the emit() method can output keys that are strings. What other types of values does it support?

The keys can be any JSON object for example (string, number, object, array, boolean or null).

2. What happens when you emit an array of values as a key?

It will emit a key of an array and a value matching the key. Arrays can be used with reduce functions to provide query time custom grouping.
