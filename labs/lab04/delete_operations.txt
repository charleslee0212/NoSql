In order to delete the value of a specific column you can just update the specific row with an empty value.
ie.
hbase> put '<table name>', '<row>', '<column name>', ''

In order to delete the entire row you can utilize the delete command specifying the row with the addition of the time stamp
ie.
hbase>delete ‘<table name>’, ‘<row>’, ‘<column name >’, ‘<time stamp>’
