The results differ from the postgres outcomes. Not only does postgres run faster, but the difference between the without index and
with index is also greater. It is strange how mongodb takes more time to operate the add_order function. I am assuming it has to
do with the lack of relational ability. Postgers has a separate table for the ingredients allowing index to be created to that specific
table maybe explaining the runtime difference. Also the runtime differs only 3 minutes which is not that significant.
