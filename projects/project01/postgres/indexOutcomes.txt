WITHOUT INDEX:

//INDEX CREATION: included extra index creation because these fields were referenced many times.
CREATE INDEX recipe_name ON recipes (name);
CREATE INDEX ingredient_info ON ingredients (name_inv, amount);
CREATE INDEX user_email ON users (email_address);

Although the the creation of index decreased the runtime of adding orders, the add_order() function utilizes the join
capabilities of psql which cannot be indexed (rather we can initialize the join table as a new table then the indexing is
possible). The creation of an index for the INNER JOIN tables will improve the runtime.
